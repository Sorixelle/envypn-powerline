# envypn-powerline
Ypnose's [envypn](https://ypnose.fr/p/pj/#envypn) bitmap font, patched with Powerline glyphs + other Unicode characters.

Originally this was only Powerline additions, but those existed already, and I was using an older version. I'm still keeping this around, just for the other Unicode glyphs that the font doesn't include.

### Supported characters:
- All Powerline glyphs
- Heavy Greek Cross (U+271A) (✚)
- Heavy Ballot X (U+2718) (✘)
- Black Circle (U+25CF) (●)
- Heavy Black Curved Upwards and Rightwards Arrow (U+27A6) (➦)
- Trigram for Heaven (U+2630) (☰)

If there are any additional glyphs you would like to see included in this font, open an issue, and I'll look into it :)
